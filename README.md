# hast-util-merge

An utility to merge [hast][] trees (elements).

The exported `mergeDocument` function merges two documents
consolidating `head`s and replacing `body` content by default.
This behaviour could be overriden,
see options in the source code.

If you need better documentation,
or the package lacks something, e.g. types,
leave a request in the issues.
